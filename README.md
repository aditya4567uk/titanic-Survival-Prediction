# titanic-Survival-Prediction
<hr>
In this project we are trying to predict the survival probablity/chance of passengeners on titanic. Here we have used Logistic Regression as a part of linear model to classify whether a particular person will survive or not. Logistic Regression offers logrithms fitting ability to fit the data points from dataset in much better way.
<br>We have used classic titatic survivor dataset from kaggle.
<br>Here we have lots of features about passengers like Sex , PassengerClass, Age ,name, ticket fare etc. but the most relevent data which can help us to find out factor of survivalibility are Sex(gender) & PassengerClass.
<br>As a matter of model building we will use Logistic regression due to it's better fitting capability as other linear models would have gone with this case. <br>Y(dependent variable/Predictive variable) = "Survived/Not Survived" & X(Independent variable) = Sex & Pclass.
